Todoist API wrapper for Meteor.

This is a wrapper for the Todoist API ([documentation](http://todoist.com/API)).
It's based on [JTarasovic/node-todoist-api](https://github.com/JTarasovic/node-todoist-api).

# Installation

`meteor add wizonesolutions:todoist`

# Usage

See the app this is used in to get ideas on how it works. It's pretty straightforward.
